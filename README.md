# HAMT-Correctness-Verification

Author: Chris Conyers 

This repository currently contains a working draft of my simple implementation of the Hash Array Mapped Trie in Coq, using Coq's binary representation of integers (Z) as keys to be
hashed into the functional, persistent HAMT data structure. As the project evolves, I will look to evolve my implementation, adding efficiency features such as sparse arrays, and
cultivate a wide range of correctness and efficiency verifications surrounding the HAMT structure.
